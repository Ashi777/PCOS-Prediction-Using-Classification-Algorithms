# PCOS-Prediction-Using-Classification-Algorithms

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition that affects women of reproductive age. It usually starts during adolescence, but symptoms may fluctuate over time.

PCOS can cause hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, excess androgen levels and cysts in the ovaries. Irregular periods, usually with a lack of ovulation, can make it difficult to become pregnant. PCOS is a leading cause of infertility.

PCOS is a chronic condition and cannot be cured. However, some symptoms can be improved through lifestyle changes, medications and fertility treatments. 

The cause of PCOS is unknown but women with a family history or type 2 diabetes are at higher risk.

PCOS a significant public health problem and is one of the commonest hormonal disturbances affecting women of reproductive age. The condition affects an estimated 8–13% of women of reproductive age, and up to 70% of cases are undiagnosed.

The prevalence of PCOS is higher among some ethnicities and these groups often experience more complications, in particular related to metabolic problems.

The biological and psychological effects of PCOS, particularly those related to obesity, body image and infertility, can lead to mental health challenges and social stigma.

Early recognition and detection of “at risk” PCOS cases in adolescent girls can prevent complications such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, infertility, and cardiovascular issues later in life.

In this project, we will be predicting whether a patient has PCOS Syndrome or not with the help of Linear Models (Logistic Regression and SVM) and Non-Linear Models (Naive Bayes and Random Forest)
